    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h4> Hello! If you decided to skip the video and explore the website I'd like to say that I'm chasing to be a very self-suffiecent guy. What I mean by that
        is towards focusing hosting my own homelab, website server, coding software/tools, and many other things. I find a love for learning lots and displaying that. 
        currently right now my website is static but I will be chasing towards making it live. Other than that I hope you enjoy! I'll continue to make my website open-source
        as my personal resume but I'm hoping to grow this into more than just that. 05/01/2025
